# Software and tools

Here are a list of tools that I regularly use and are extremely helpful for my research. 

## Reference manager
### Zotero 
This is an essential tool to manage your literature. Some useful plugins: 
- [Zetero Better Notes](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes#readme), 
- [Zotero Citation Counts Manager](https://github.com/eschnett/zotero-citationcounts), 
- [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/)

## Programming

### Jupyter Notebook 
An interactive notebook for programming in Python/R. 

### Visual Studio Code 
A powerful code editor for programmer with a large developer community.

## Writing
### Overleaf -- online LaTex editor
A visual LaTex editor that helps with writing manuscripts (free for personal use).
### Obsidian -- markdown editor
A markdown editor that is good for taking notes. See this [blog](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2022/10/21/markdown-based-scientific-and-computational-note-taking-with-obsidian/) on a quick introduction.

I have written a tutorial on integrating Zotero with Obsidian for taking literature notes.
