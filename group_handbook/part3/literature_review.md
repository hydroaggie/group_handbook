# How to do literature review

Literature review is the first step towards research.

## Tools 
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is my top choice for finding papers. Other useful search engines include [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic), [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos), [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/), etc. You may want to try different combination of keywords to find the right articles.
- [Elicit](https://elicit.com) An AI tool for finding papers. I often use this along with Google Scholar for best results.
- [Litmaps](https://app.litmaps.com/) A useful AI tool if you have already found one paper. It can generate a map showing all the cited and citing papers based on a single paper you provided.
- [SCISPACE](https://typeset.io/) An AI tool for finding literature. Similar to Elicit.

## Tutorials
- An [article](https://ilyashabanov.substack.com/p/the-effortless-literature-review) on how to do literature review using some of the AI tools like litmaps.Â They use a method to select the top 10% recent papers, 10% highly cited papers, and 10% review papers to start the review process.
