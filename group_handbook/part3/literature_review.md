# How to do literature review

Literature review is the first step towards research.

## tools 
- [Google Scholar]() for finding papers
- [elicit]() An AI tool for finding papers. I use this along with Google Scholar for best results.
- [litmaps]() A useful AI tool if you have already found one paper. It can generate a map showing all the cited and citing papers based on a single paper you provided.

## tutorials
- An [article](https://ilyashabanov.substack.com/p/the-effortless-literature-review) on how to do literature review using some of the AI tools like litmaps.Â They use a method to select the top 10% recent papers, 10% highly cited papers, and 10% review papers to start the review process.
