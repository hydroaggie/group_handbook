# How to write a scientific paper

Here are the steps I take for writing an academic paper.
- Conduct literature review to find out any knowledge gap and questions
- Conduct the experiements analyze results
- Put key figures in a slide to telll a story (storyboarding)
- Once the story is complete, write the manuscript. 
- Start from key sentences in your introduction. Start paragraph with key sentence, then support the argument with 3~5 sentences.  Similary, do this for results and discussion.
- Methods and results are often easy to write. Leave this when you are not in yourself. Write introduction/discussion when you are at your best moment (early in the morning, no distraction).
- Re-read the manuscript when it is done. 

## Abstract

A good abstract follows the scheme below:
- Describe the broad problem you are solving (1 sentence)
	- Introduce the broader field
	- What is the problem?
- Provide context needed to understand your study (1 sentence)
	- What is missing in the literature (or the knowledge gap)? Why that matters? 
	- A successful context distinguishes your study from others.
- State the content of your study by describing your approach to fill the gap (1 sentence)
	- "Here, we investigated...using xx approach"
- Summarise your key results (2~3 sentences). 
	- What did you find? 
	- What is the main conclusion?
- State the broad perspective or significance of the study (1 sentence).
	- What is the broad impact/implication of the study?
	- Highlight the important implications
