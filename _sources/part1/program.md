```{note}
- **F**: Fall, **Sp**: Spring, **Su**: Summer
- The first paper usually takes much longer time to write, so I would suggest start early. Depending on individuals, a draft may take up to three months to write and additional few months to iterate between advisor and student before it is ready for submission. For example, if your goal is to submit your first paper by the end of the second year, you need to have all results/analysis done by the end of Y2-Spring and spend the entire summer writing and editing.
- The Proposal Defense has to occur at least one year before the Dissertation Defense.
- Must submit dissertation/thesis draft to committee at least four weeks before defense.
- Must submit Appointment for Examination form to the School of Graduate Studies at least two weeks before defense.
