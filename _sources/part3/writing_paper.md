# How to write a scientific paper

Here are the steps I take for writing an academic paper.
- Conduct literature review to find out any knowledge gap and questions
- Conduct the experiements analyze results
- Put key figures in a slide to telll a story (storyboarding)
- Once the story is complete, write the manuscript. 
- Start from key sentences in your introduction. Start paragraph with key sentence, then support the argument with 3~5 sentences.  Similary, do this for results and discussion.
- Methods and results are often easy to write. Leave this when you are not in yourself. Write introduction/discussion when you are at your best moment (early in the morning, no distraction).
- Re-read the manuscript when it is done. 

## Abstract

Abstract follows the template:
- Describe the broad problem your paper solves (1 sentence)
	- What is the problem?
- Provide context needed to understand your study (1 sentence)
	- Why are we doing this study? What is the knowledge gap?
- State the central message of your study (1 sentence)
	- "Here, we investigated...using xx approach"
- Summarise your results (2~3 sentences). This should be the key findings.
	- What did you find? 
- State the broad perspective (1 sentence).
	- What is the broad impact/implication of the study?
